Overview: X-Men is an unreleased game developed for the Sega 32X. It was set to be an exclusive title for the system, but was cancelled for unknown reasons. A working title appears to have been X-Men: Mind Games. A prototype was dumped by Ryo Suzuki of SegaSaturno.com in August 2009. Most emulators will not run the game, however it is compatible with the latest releases of Kega Fusion. This prototype is very incomplete, and though gives hints that X-Men characters Wolverine, Rogue and Iceman would be playable, you can only control Bishop. Magazine shots show that the game progressed far enough for Wolverine to be included as a playable character. It has been suggested that the game eventually became the Sega Saturn/PlayStation/DOS game, The Incredible Hulk: The Pantheon Saga.

Overview: The universe is made up of human and synthetic lifeforms. Synthetic lifeforms are considered second class citizens by their human counterparts. The story takes place on the prison planet Alpha Prime, a world completely designed for the holding of criminals. You are a synthetic lifeform sentenced for an eternity for a crime you didn't commit and in order to earn your freedom, you must compete against other prisoners in competitions in 10 different incarceration facilities. To compete in these competitions however, you must undergo a procedure that removes your legs and replaces it with a rolling sphere. There are seven different events to compete in which are Pursuit, Last Man Rolling, Race, King of the Hill, Run the Gauntlet, Tag, and Powerball that pit you not only against your fellow inmates and guards, but against the levels themselves. Run the gauntlet charges you with making it to a goal point within a time limit, all the while avoiding other warriors and obstacles such as flame throwers, spikes, and gun turrets. Pursuit is identical, but it adds the challenge of the arena crumbling away. Powerball has you collecting balls throughout the arena and throwing them at a goalpost before time runs out. Tag has you collecting a set number of tokens that have been scattered throughout the arena within a set time limit.

It is designed to be played by one to four players, in turn. It is an emulation of a pinball machine. The pinball machine rendered in Rollerball is composed of four screens, which, by proportion, would be about as long as two standard pinball tables if it were a real table. The graphics on two of the four screens are based on various aspects of the New York City skyline. The topmost screen (hereafter called the bonus screen) merely shows some clouds and a blimp. The second screen (the main screen) shows the top of the Empire State Building, while the third screen (intermediate) shows the lower skyline and the Statue of Liberty. The lowest (final) screen shows only a blue backdrop, representing the Ocean.

Overview: You are the Cannon Man and you have to shoot the bouncing ball. When you hit the ball it will fall apart in two or three smaller balls and If you hit those smaller balls, they will also fall apart into two or three smaller balls. And if you hit the smallest balls again they will disappear. The gameplay is straightforward, you can only move from left to right and can shoot straight up. Don't get hit by the bouncing balls!

Overview: Here's an original twist – a hexagonal pool table! You can play against a friend or the computer at any one of over twenty different table layouts. There are only seven balls on the table instead of the normal fifteen, and if you fail to pot a ball three times, you lose the frame. There's not that much else to say about it, but one nice feature is that you can design your own table layouts and save and load them for later use.
